Analog feedback loops work differently than digitally processed feedback loops like this one.  In computer programming, you need to set a feedback delay in a feedback loop because a value cannot be processed before it is created - that would be time travel!  If you do not assign a feedback delay point with a Feedback Delay node, Audulus will pick a spot for you.  Often, where the feedback delay happens does not affect the feedback loop.  However, this loop needs the delay to happen at a particular point to function correctly.  This Feedback Delay node needs to be in this position - between the output of the Sample & Hold node and the input of the CurrentNumber variable for the Reset button to work correctly.  When the Reset button is pushed, it triggers the Sample & Hold and it also flips the Crossfade node to input B from input A.  With nothing attached, input B has a value of zero.  We want the Sample & Hold node to sample this zero value to return the Demux node's select value back to 0 (really, -1 after the Sample-1 expression).  If the feedback delay occurs between the output of the counter expression and the input of A, the Sample & Hold node will not \"see\" B's zero value - it will sample instead from A's input.  Adding the Feedback delay between the Sample & Hold node and the CurrentNumber expression fixes this.  If this is all too confusing to you - don't worry.  If you have a feedback loop and everything's working fine, but you close and then reopen the program and it seems broken - you don't need to understand how or why a Feedback Delay node needs to be in a particular place.  Just try sticking it between each connection in the feedback loop until it works correctly.","width":356.01767},{"type":"Text","id":"57a06d96-24c0-4100-8c7a-919f846d4bb2","position":{"x":-1185.99341,"y":-611.03467},"text":"This is a counter expression.

What stops this from happening here is the Sample and Hold node that exists within the feedback loop.  Compare the output of the expression to the output of the Sample & Hold node.  You'll see that the next value is \"waiting\" at the Sample & Hold node's input.  However, nothing will pass from the Sample & Hold's input to its output unless its trigger is pulsed.

You can tell this is happening because all of the red lights go off in unison when the patch is first opened.  With this counter in place, only the samples you've programmed will pass.  Once you've programmed all 8 samples, continuing to push the Rhythm button will simply overwrite the samples, wrapping back around to 1 and starting again.
