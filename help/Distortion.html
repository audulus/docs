<body><h3>Distortion</h3>
<p><img alt="icon" src="img/icons/distortion.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Distortion</strong> node adds harmonics to a signal by applying a sigmoid
function to the signal. As the input signal becomes larger, the sigmoid
behaves more like a step function.</p>
<p>To create a great rock distortion sound for electric guitar, run a
<a href="#highpass">HighPass</a> node before the distortion, to give the guitar some
tightness and a <a href="#lowpass">LowPass</a> node after as a tone control. Adjust the
<a href="#highpass">HighPass</a> for more of a fuzzy sound. Connect this to a good old tube
amp and commence rocking.</p></body>
