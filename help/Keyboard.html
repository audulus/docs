<body><h3>Keyboard</h3>
<p><img alt="icon" src="img/icons/keyboard.png" /></p>
<p>The keyboard node converts MIDI note messages as well as interaction
with its on-screen keyboard into <strong>pitch</strong> and <strong>velocity</strong> signals.</p>
<p>Pitch is expressed as the fundamental frequency of the note in Hertz.
MIDI note velocities are scaled to a zero-to-one range.</p>
<p>The keybaord has two modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Legato</em>. Only one note at a time, and notes will not be
    re-triggered.</li>
<li><em>Poly (2-16)</em>. Polyphonic - multiple notes can be played simultaneously. The number of voices is specified in parenthesis: 2, 4, 8, or 16.</li>
</ul>
<p>When in poly mode, the keybaord's pitch and velocity outputs become
polyphonic, shown as thicker connections. Polyphonic processing can consume considerably more CPU time than monophoic processing. To support polyphony
efficiently in your patch, use the #PolyToMono node, which will mix the
polyphonic signals to monophonic. Also, don't use more voices than you need.</p></body>
