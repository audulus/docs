<p>The <strong>Sample &amp; Hold</strong> (S &amp; H) node samples a value from its input when
its trigger input increases across zero (the positive edge). The current
sampled value is written to the output.</p>
<p>S &amp; H is often used to generate stair-step functions by sampling a LFO
or random (noise) waveform and periodic intervals. It can also be used
for syncronization of notes with a master clock.</p></body>
