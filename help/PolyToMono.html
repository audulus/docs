<body><h3>PolyToMono</h3>
<p><img alt="icon" src="img/icons/poly%20to%20mono.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>PolyToMono</strong> node mixes a polyphonic input (denoted by a thick
wire) to a monophonic output (thin wire). Each voice is mixed equally.</p>
<p>Typically, you'll want to place linear effects (reverb, delay, EQ) after
the PolyToMono, since it will sound the same as placing them before but
only a single voice needs to be processed. On the other hand, nonlinear
effects, such as #Distortion will have quite a different effect if
placed before the PolyToMono versus after.</p></body>
